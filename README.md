# Description of Design

Using jQuery and Ajax, I used to functions to:

1. Generate query URLs for APIs
2. Use an event listener for a click when the user submits the search term aka city
3. Get the specific data I needed from the returned API query
4. Query each API for data
5. Create spaces on the page for the data to display and
7. Convert returned icons into pictures
